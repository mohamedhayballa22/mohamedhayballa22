## Hello 👋

This is my personal Github account where i push code at my free time for fun! Yes, i very much like my job to the point where i find myself coding or consuming computer science content regularly. In a perfect world, you would see all the projects i worked on but for obvious reasons, you can't. I recently decided to change this by developing the habit of creating in my free time to eventually commit and push to public repos.

- 📍​ Based in Paris, France
- 🏢 I’m currently working full time at JCDecaux
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the intricacies of Kubernetes 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I still use Stack Overflow on a daily basis
